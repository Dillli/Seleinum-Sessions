#MavenHybridFramework
This Framework will help you to Automate Web Applications.
This Framework is designed using below Tools and Technologies:
Selenium WebDriver API to Automate Web Applications.
Core Java as a Programming Language.
Page Object Model Design Pattern to Maintain WebElements.
Maven is used as Build Automation Tool that can be used to Execute Project from Command Prompt also to Integrate the Project with CI Tools - Jenkins Or Bamboo. Check out below Repository for Executing Project from Command Prompt and Implemented Profile Concept when in working with Multiple testng.xml Files. https://github.com/PavanReddy77/MavenSurefirePlugin
TestNG is used as Test Driven Development Framework which comes with some Amazing Features that helps to Design a Robust Framework.
Apache POI APIs to Drive Data from Excel Files. Also, used DataProvider Concept that is provided by TestNG.
WebDriverEventListener to Generate Useful Logs in the Console during Tests Execution.
Log4j API to Generate Loggers.
Extent Report API to Generate Excellent Test Report.
Retry Logic to Execute Failed Test Scripts with More Chances Automatically at Run Time.

Driving the Common Properties like Url, Username and Password from Configuration.properites File.
All Common Methods have been written in src/main/java/com/crm/qa/Utilities/TestUtility.java
Failed Test Screenshot that gets added into Extent Report - Code is Written in TestBase.java Class.
#MavenSurefirePlugin #MavenProfile
This repository will help you to execute Maven Project from Command Line Prompt and also to execute required testng.xml file from Command Line Prompt when in working with multiple testng.xml files.
#Maven Surefire Plugin
Pre-Requisites: Maven Jar Files must be downloaded and path must be set for the same in System Environment Variables.
To Execute Maven Project from Command Line Prompt, we need Maven Surefire Plugin which you will find in pom.xml file.
#Maven Profile Concept
In general, If we do not use Maven Profiling when in working with multiple testng.xml files. Each time we need to go to pom.xml file and change the name of testng.xml file in Maven Surefire Plugin which needs to be executed and it is a very tedious task to do every time. So, It is a good practice to implement Maven Profile Concept when in working with multiple testng.xml files.
[Multiple testng.xml files >> We maintain sanity_testng.xml, smoke_testng.xml, regresssion_testng.xml].
